Your will power is what will save you, especially if you are able to harness your energy in a valuable and meaningful direction.

<p><strong>Sagittarius</strong></p>

<p><strong>Capricorn</strong></p>

<p>The sun in your own sign of Capricorn indicates struggles in your relationship with your father. Capricorn rules the patriarch and all things that it represents, including time and money. There is a sense of rigidness in all Capricorn’s, an innate need to accrue things and to follow a sense of order and timeliness. If your relationship with your father is poor, try to mend it now. Your desire to expand your energy in a new direction is strong and should be utilised. On the 13th, the sun moves into Aquarius giving you the opportunity to rid yourself of a chronic illness.

<p><strong>Aquarius </strong></p>

Your self-confidence escalates, and you feel you can do anything. A busy schedule may leave you to feel that you can’t do it all – this is where organisation and planning will be useful. With Mercury in Capricorn you may feel lazy and lacking in confidence. On the 7th, Mercury moves into Aquarius and your ability to concentrate may be dampened making it crucial that you learn how to dim down the distractions. Even the best minds make little progress if they are constantly side-lined by every bright, shiny new thing that comes along.
