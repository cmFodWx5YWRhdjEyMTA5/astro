<p><strong>Gemini Horoscope 2019</strong></p>

<hr />
<p>Though Mercury transits are quite frequent, they are important considerations for the Gemini Horoscope 2019 as the planet rules the Gemini sign. Mercury will be placed in your 6th house at the beginning of 2019. This year starts with the cosmic blessing of domestic bliss and spending quality time with your loved ones. Your family will come to your aid as your support system and will stand by you through the most stressful times. You may plan a leisure trip with your family this year, and create some wonderful memories with them that will be cherished for years to come. After all, life is not just about pay checks and the bank balance. This year, Gemini, all of your hard work and dedication will begin to pay off in all aspects of life: career, family, love, health and finance. The Universe will start reciprocating to the hard work you have put in over the years, and the rewards will be plentiful in 2019. You may find it hard to remain focused and diligent in your efforts, by April you will be tempted to stop your perpetual efforts and a new goal may seem more achievable and interesting. Maintain the focus, structure and discipline in each of your endeavours. You being the most adaptive of all the sun signs can get used to any new endeavours. In fact, change is something you embrace wholeheartedly. You are always willing to accept and chase the “hot new thing”. You should not fall for this, you know how hard you have been trying and you cannot let all that hard work get squandered in vain. These temptations are induced by the retrogression of Jupiter on 11th April and the retrogression of Saturn on 30th April and will pass with time.</p>

<p>Students will have to work hard this year to achieve their desired goals and aspirations. Dear light-hearted friend, it’s time to stay focused; it won’t be easy for you but that doesn’t mean it is impossible. All your endeavours and undertakings will be well supported by your partner if you are in a relationship. Their moral and emotional support will give you a lot of strength and confidence. You may come across a lot of changes on the work front this year. But you will like most of these changes and it would break the monotony and the mundane nature of work which you are not really a fan of.  In the last quarter of 2019, you will be offered help by a senior to grow professionally. You should make the best use of this opportunity to surge ahead.</p>

<p>The Scorpio Horoscope 2019 would be mainly based on Mars transits and positioning of the year as it is the ruling planet of the zodiac sign. New Year will begin with Mars in your fifth house and Jupiter and Mercury in your first house.  2019 is going to be a year full of excitement and unique experiences for you. 2019 will surprise you with a lot of revelations. This year will mark a milestone in the evolution of your character and persona. Couples who are planning to have a baby will be blessed this year. You will certainly get things done! Any work that relates to water or is situated close to water will be beneficial for you as it puts you close to your element and through this, you may find yourself more in touch with your best qualities. You will be gregarious and warm with friends and family throughout the year and relationships will be better than they have been in a long time. Remember that we learn about ourselves in two ways: the first is through self-reflection and the second is by being with others and getting to know their observations and perspective. So pay attention to their opinion and make necessary changes if you think they are required. Your health will be wonderful as long as you adhere to a disciplined regime. Do you already have one in place? If not, start this at the earliest! If you are into business, you might land up in a sticky situation during June 2019, a part of you may be itching to take a risk and the other half worried about the results. A third eye perspective never hurts; seek the advice and guidance of an experienced person in such situations. </p>

<p>You move through life like the element that represents you- water, you are an enigma of wondrous extremes. One day, you may be calm and collected, with a glassy surface; the next, you are a tidal wave headed for shore. Your liquid nature makes you both highly energetic at the same time highly emotional. Both of these qualities have the potential to overwhelm you in life, but in 2019, the Universe offers you great opportunities to learn and to control your emotions and harness your energy, which will create many wonderful new things in your life. Just like water’s ability to alter terrain and power great cities, you have an amazing power within yourself, Scorpio. Positive thinking will help you gain control over your own power. You will experience some pressures at work during April – March and possibly some dental problems. Don’t allow your emotions to take control of your mind in such situations. Going to see a therapist or having a mentor is a great idea, as they will be able to teach you many tools and methods for staying positive and avoiding depressive states. Socialization will make you feel like an important and intricate part of your community in 2019. You will be confident enough to take on the world, and by the year&#39;s end, you will see much improvement in all areas of your life! </p>

<p><strong>Capricorn Horoscope 2019</strong></p>

<hr />
<p>Saturn is the lord of Capricorn and our expert astrologers have analysed the retrogression, progression and also the transit of this planet before coming up with the Capricorn Horoscope 2019. Capricorn is the sign that manifests hard work and ambition. 2019 will throw a curveball your way. This New Year will be one laden with opportunities on every front, but they will come at a price. You will face stiff competition at work with new players sprouting up on a regular basis, but you will remain the cream of the crop due to your sincerity and hard work. Your willpower is unbelievable and unparalleled, so you can achieve all that you need to do. You will surprise yourself this year with how strong your resolve can be. If you are searching for love then put tremendous efforts towards finding a compatible partner during the April-May months of 2019. The stars indicate that this time period is favourable for the blossoming of new relationships. This is also a great time to get out of your comfort zone and into something new. So pack your bags and head out for an adventure as you may end up having the time of your life! You might even do something as daring as skydiving this year if adventure sports are on your bucket list. There’s good news on the love front too, your love life will be rewarding and the next big step in your relationship is just around the corner. In true Capricorn style, your vibe in the New year will be understated and you will not be bothered by the bright lights of fame but you do want to be acknowledged, after all, Capricorns do crave status.</p>

<p>Your ambitions and goals for 2019 are impressive, Capricorn. The Universe respects your desire to succeed, but in 2019, you will need to step carefully when you choose the path to success. Remember that although you are skilful and competitive, you have many people surrounding you that form a huge support system for you. Don&#39;t forget these important people; remember to continually express your gratitude for them. In January, a close friend will ask you for financial help. Help him/her if you are in a good financial position as it will reinforce a loyal friendship that you will depend on later in the year. Your continued quest for good investment options will bring you slow and steady financial gains, beginning in March and culminating in July. You will be congratulating yourself on this successful endeavour, Capricorn, but be careful not to get complacent. You will have the intention to build upon everything you touch in 2019. Nothing is ever enough as it is; it has to be grown, cultivated, encouraged and exaggerated. Whether it’s your career, a business or a hobby, you want to make the most out of it. Others may envy how seemingly perfect your life appears to them. You may be sensitive to this, or self-conscious of it, but you will never sabotage yourself to make others feel better.</p>

<p><strong>Aquarius Horoscope 2019</strong></p>

<hr />
<p>Saturn transits of 2019 are important for all zodiac signs, but since Saturn is the ruling planet for Aquarius, it is given more emphasis for coming up with the predictions for the Aquarius Horoscope 2019. You are one of the most independent signs of the zodiac; a perpetual seeker of truth and a true leader who refuses to follow the crowd. 2019 will be an exciting year for you as your ideas will cease to exist in the realm of your mind only and you will see many of your ideas turn into reality. However, the road is not as easy as you might imagine, the stars indicate that you will be faced with some strong challenges along the way; the universe will test your determination and consistency. Don’t give in to self-doubt and negativity, push through the trouble and you will find success waiting for you on the other side.  Being an air sign you might get obsessed with your opinions and viewpoints, as you feel they are crucial to your identity. Remember to relax at this time and take a step back from your thoughts. Sometimes a new way of looking at the world can bring in many benefits.  You will get an opportunity to be part of a creative project in the workplace during the first quarter of 2019. The project will be very appealing and interesting for you, and, you will completely indulge yourself in it. Your work and innovativeness will impress those around you. Trust your instincts and innovative ideas; this venture is sure to be a success. Springtime in 2019 will bring luck in love, dear airy friend, so be consistent with your efforts in that department. Expect a surprise gift from your siblings or cousins sometime around June 2019. Last quarter of 2019 may drain your wallet due to medical expenses; consider buying a medical insurance at least by mid-2019 if you don’t have one.</p>

<p>For health reasons, try to reduce sugar intake and processed foods.  A good diet is important for balanced emotions and mental health. It is natural for you to take charge in all areas. You bring a level of enthusiasm to anything you get involved in, in 2019. Endless opportunities are coming your way in all major aspects of life. You will make your partner feel grateful for having you in his/her life. At work, there may be a degree of tension during April 2019, but nothing that you cannot tackle. Fame has never been a motivator for you and it will be so in 2019 also, in fact, you see yourself above such things. The last quarter of 2019 is a romantic period for you, you will feel the need to share, exchange and communicate with your loved one. Romance will be even more exciting if your partner is an air or fire sign, sparks are sure to fly! </p>

<p><strong>Pisces Horoscope 2019</strong></p>

<hr />
<p>Jupiter rules Pisces and we will see the planet transiting, retrograding and entering progression state in 2019. The Pisces Horoscope 2019 has been put forth after carefully examining these planetary movements by Astroyogi’s expert astrologers. Mystical Pisces, 2019 will be bedazzling for you. Your ability to read people well and your understanding of your own needs should be capitalised in 2019. There are chances of a conflict with your mother during the April-May months of the New Year. You know by now how to self-soothe so make sure that you calm yourself down by treating yourself with something relaxing like a body massage.  Fill your inner well, so that you will never experience a drought of self-love. Comfort and joy matter to you so when you are planning a vacation in 2019 pick adventures far away from home that can feed these needs. Your rich imagination and a deep, sensitive soul will help you to showcase your artistic side in 2019. This year, you can expect new growth in spirituality and religious ideology. Intuition and gut feeling will help you a great deal this year, with business and personal relationships. Your intuition is one of your strongest qualities, not only you, but many of your loved ones also depend on it. Everyone around you deeply trusts your hunches, dear fishy friend.  </p>

<p>During April 2019, you will be called upon for help by a dear friend. He/she may ask you for guidance regarding a crucial matter in their life; it will likely be a dire financial situation. Trust your instinct on this one, and offer your friend the advice that immediately comes to your mind. Early spring of 2019 will bring you a wonderful and auspicious time of great positivity, my friend. You will experience a period of great health, energy and creativity during early January. During this time, artists and entrepreneurs will be able to produce great things in your business and artistic endeavours. By early December, you will see one of your biggest dreams begin to manifest! Hard work is a key ingredient for success this year; you need to reciprocate all that luck and serendipity from the universe with your honest efforts. You are not the competitive type, as deep down your kind and sensitive heart wants everyone to be successful. Your enemies are going to taste the dust in 2019, with the planets playing on your side.</p>
